# Fist To One

In classes at Turing School of Software & Design, our teachers would perform comprehension checks during lessons called Fist To Five. Everyone in the class raised their fist an indicated with a number of fingers their level of understanding, 0 fingers being the least comprehension and 5 fingers being the most understanding.

Turing lessons moved quickly, sometimes so quickly that our heads felt like they were just spinning round and round. Jokingly, we developed Fist To One... the one being our middle fingers to represent utter confusion. As a fun side project, we decided to turn our hand gestures in to an app.
